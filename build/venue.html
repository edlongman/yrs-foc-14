Seats are reserved for mentors, centre leads, kids, and guardians of kids 13 and under. If there is any additional space left over on the coach, we will let you know and will open up these seats to other family members and friends. Tickets are sold on first come, first served basis and will no longer be available from 1 July. Book your ticket <a href="">here</a>.</p><h2>Car</h2><p>Car parks are available at both the University and Plymouth Pavilions, and daily permits will need to be purchased.</p><h2>Hybrid Travel </h2><p>While most centre's travel routes are obvious, some are not.
