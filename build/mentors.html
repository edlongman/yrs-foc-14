Traditionally it has been drawn from the Rewired State network, but as the popularity of the week has grown, so has the mentor network.</p><p>Indeed some of you mentors will be YRS alumni and we hope that as the years go by, your number will grow at the same rate as new attendees.	</p></section><section><h2>What is a Mentor?</h2><p>It is a gentle art of being sensitive to the needs of the YRSers in attendance, some will require encouragement, some will need to be left alone. As the event progresses it becomes about focus and preparation for presentations.</p><p>Mentors will also reach out beyond the room to people in their own networks who may be able to assist with specific challenges for their assigned centre.</p></section><section><h2>Skill set for mentors</h2><p>We are looking for a diverse range of skills from our mentors, including but not limited to:</p><ul><li>Data mining</li><li>Experience using open data</li><li>Design</li><li>Ideation</li><li>Presentation skills</li><li>Programming in all types of languages</li><li>UX</li></ul></section><section><h2>Mentor Responsibilities</h2><ul><li>Providing expertise in your field, which can include development, design, presentation skills, agile, effective ideation, robotics or data crunching</li><li>Assisting the centre lead in curating the room</li><li>Assessing skills and encouraging collaboration</li></ul></section><section><h2>DBS Checks</h2><p>For the week work in centres you do not need to be DBS checked. We run the week under the rules of work experience, and you will only be around the YRSers in a single open space.</p><p>If you come to the Festival weekend you would continue to mentor under the rules of work experience, but only DBS-checked adults will be around the young programmers during times when they are not all together, i.e. out-of-hours and overnight.</p></section><div class="register"><a href="https://youngrewiredstate.org/events/gb/2014/festival-of-code/signup/mentor">Register as a mentor now</a></div></div><div class="aside"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/o4xMxriKETQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><h1>Mentors FAQ</h1><ul><li><h2>Do I need to be an experienced developer?</h2><p>No, not at all. We need mentors across multiple skillsets, including development, design and business. We do need you to be as clear as possible about your skills though.</p></li><li><h2>Do I need to be available all week?</h2><p>We appreciate that you are giving up your time. You do not need to be availbale all week, but we need you to be explicit about when you are free. You are welcome to the show and tell if you'd like to be there.</p></li><li><h2>Will you cover my travel costs?</h2><p>We run this event on the smell of an oily rag, this is a voluntary activity - and we are sorry that we cannot help you financially. We do wish we could.</p></li></ul></div></div><footer></footer></body></html>
