The only expense you expect you to make is travel to and from the centre and food. Some centres will provide food, some will have a cafeteria to buy lunch, and other will expect participants to bring their own lunch with them. You'll find out more closer to the event.</p></li><li><h2>Is there help with the cost of travel?</h2><p>Yes. We have a hardship fund that can be applied to to cover the cost of travel. Forms for this will be sent in advance of the week.</p></li><li><h2>How will I get my child to Plymouth?</h2><p>The centres will organise group travel either by train, plane, car, or coach. This is organised by your centre lead, but you are welcome to make alternate plans separate from the centre.</p></li><li><h2>Do you teach kids how to code?</h2><p>No, we foster children who have already learnt how to code. We believe in peer-to-peer learning so inspire them to learn and then give them a community of peers and mentors to help them teach themselves, and real-world challenges to address to test and build their skills and knowledge.</p></li></ul></div></div><footer></footer></body></html>
