			h2 What is the Festival of Code?
			p.
				We want to prevent the isolation that often comes with learning to program, and create a network of young people supporting each other through learning and solving real world challenges.
			p.
				The Festival of Code is run with the principles of community, open source and open data and is ultimately about finding and fostering every child driven to teach themselves how to code.
			p.
				Young Rewired State is led by Emma Mulqueeny, who is a Mum of two, a team of DBS-checked employees, vetted volunteers and part-time staff.

		h1 Parent FAQ
		ul
			li
				h2 How much does it cost?
				p.
					It's compeltely free. The only expense you expect you to make is travel to and from the centre and food. Some centres will provide food, some will have a cafeteria to buy lunch, and other will expect participants to bring their own lunch with them. You'll find out more closer to the event.
			li
				h2 Is there help with the cost of travel?
				p.
					Yes. We have a hardship fund that can be applied to to cover the cost of travel. Forms for this will be sent in advance of the week.
			li
				h2 How will I get my child to Plymouth?
				p.
					The centres will organise group travel either by train, plane, car, or coach. This is organised by your centre lead, but you are welcome to make alternate plans separate from the centre.
			li
				h2 Do you teach kids how to code?
				p.
					No, we foster children who have already learnt how to code. We believe in peer-to-peer learning so inspire them to learn and then give them a community of peers and mentors to help them teach themselves, and real-world challenges to address to test and build their skills and knowledge.
