			h2 Coach
			p.
				If your centre is within a rough 4.5 hour driving distance, we will book a coach for the centre to pick you up on Friday. To get a return seat, this will cost each person &pound;35. On Sunday, the coach will drive everyone from Plymouth back to their local centre. Seats are reserved for mentors, centre leads, kids, and guardians of kids 13 and under. If there is any additional space left over on the coach, we will let you know and will open up these seats to other family members and friends. Tickets are sold on first come, first served basis and will no longer be available from 1 July. Click the button below to book your ticket.
